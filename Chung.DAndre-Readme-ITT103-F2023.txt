This program is a student registration system that should add students and courses to a system. 
The program calculates the fee that the students would pay for each course. 
The total for each student depends on how many courses they have signed up for and the cost per course. 
The program also allows you to pay for the course as well.

To run the program you will need a pyhton interpreter. Just copy code and paste to the interpreter or download the file and 
open using the application.

The program assumes that you have courses and students to add, it also doesnt have a tested limit for students and courses.
You cannot use the same ID numbers for stundents and courses it will cause confusion in the code. 
There is no surplus funds set for students.
